# predictive-modeling-work

Hi! I'm Tom Fleming and the purpose of this repository is to share some of the predictive modeling work I have completed recently. I plan on updating it occasionally, as I enhance or complete more work.

Here is a list of programs in the repo, along with brief descriptions.


predict_home_price.ipynb

Linear Regression: Data cleaning, data transformation, model build, and model evaluation using a CSV of data on 21,613 houses in the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area. In this exercise, I am attempting to predict housing price for this population. The input dataset is also included in the repo as home_data.csv, as well as a script of custom functions called toms_custom_functions.py, most of which are used in predict_home_price.ipynb.
